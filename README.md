### Comments and Take Aways
This assignment was challenging but also enjoyable. I struggled to grasp the fetch and route, but i re read a bunch of notes and finally got some basic html to show up. A few more hours of debugging and realising i had my path directories a little messed up things start working.

I have personally noticed growth in myself during 262. I am starting to understand the language of JavaScript, which is also improving my problem solving skills in coding.

Learning about ejs an including html into our project's without really writing any is cool and and i have enjoyed learning about incorpriating frontend into the backend.

ALSO THANKS FOR THE SATURDAY STUDY SESSION. IT HELPED ALOT!!
